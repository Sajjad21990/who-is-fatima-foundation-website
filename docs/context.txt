2. About Us
Who We Are
Who is Fatima Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing education to the community. We started our journey with a simple belief – every child deserves the right to quality learning, regardless of financial background.
· Founded: Who is Fatima Foundation is established to uplift the community through education and skill development.
· Motto: “Deen ke sath, Duniya bhi.”
· Values:
	o Education for All – Making learning accessible to every child.
	o Community First – Focusing on Shia community upliftment through collective efforts.
	o Integrity & Transparency – Building trust with students, parents, donors, and partners.

Our Vision & Mission
· Vision:
To establish Sakina Education & Research Centers (SERCs) at every Shia Jama Masjid in Mumbai and provide quality education that builds skills, confidence, and opportunities for the next generation.
· Mission:
	1. Provide affordable and accessible education to underprivileged children.

👥 Our Team
· Founder & Director: Your Name
	o Visionary behind WFF, working to establish education centers across Mumbai and beyond.
· Key Members:
	o Sakina Education & Research Center (Mumbai Team) – Teachers and trainers running computer classes in Malad and Mira Road.
	o Edulight Global School (Jogipura Team) – Qualified teachers managing classes till 5th standard under the Delhi Board.
· Advisors & Supporters:
	o Community elders, educationists, and local Shia Jama Masjid committees who guide and support our projects.

Our Approach
Education is the most powerful tool to uplift any community. Unfortunately, many children in our Shia community are unable to access quality education due to financial and social barriers. We addresses this gap with a practical and community-based model:
· Why Focus on the Shia Community?
	o Many families in our community cannot afford private schooling.
	o Children often miss out on computer education and modern skills.
	o By focusing on our community first, we create a strong foundation for growth, dignity, and self-reliance.
· Why the SERC (Sakina Education & Research Center) Model?
	o Community-based: Located inside Shia Jama Masjids so education is accessible and safe.
	o Affordable & Sustainable: Low-cost programs, supported by donations and volunteers.
	o Skill-Oriented: Focus on computer literacy and modern education to prepare students for future opportunities.
	o Scalable: Once successful in one masjid, it can be replicated in others across Mumbai.
Through this approach, WFF ensures that every child gets a chance to learn, grow, and contribute back to the community.
