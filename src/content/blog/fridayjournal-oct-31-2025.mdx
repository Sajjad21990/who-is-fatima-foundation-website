 Just as the young man was about to leave, the 
elder smiled and said,“Remember, every needy, 
wounded, or poor person is in truth sent to test 
you on behalf of us, the Ahl al-Bayt (a.s.). 
Whoever aids them, aids us.”
 Without a moment’s delay, the young man 
gathered some food, took water, and followed the 
old man. They walked through the narrow streets 
until they reached a desolate corner where indeed 
a stranger lay on the ground, injured. The young 
man lifted him up, gave him water, offered food, and 
tore his own clothes to bandage the wounds. The 
traveller began to recover and looked at the young 
man with grateful eyes. 
 The young man stood alone in the empty street. 
His heartbeat quickened, tears streamed from his 
eyes. He returned to his room and fell to the ground 
in prostration, weeping:
 The old man did not reply. He simply looked into 
the young man’s eyes for a moment — a gaze that 
erased the darkness of years in a single instant. 
And then suddenly... the scene vanished. The elder 
was gone. The wounded traveller was gone. 
 That very night, he dreamt of the Imam, 
majestic and radiant. From his blessed lips came 
these words:“Perhaps it was that same knock upon 
your door that night.”
 The young man felt as though lightning had 
struck his heart. He asked in a trembling 
voice,“Who are you? Are you... my Master?”
“O Master of the Time! I felt you, I recognized you, 
but my sins have hidden you from my sight.”

“O my Lord, O my Imam of the Time, how I wish I 
could be blessed with your visitation, how I wish 
my eyes could behold the radiance of your 
countenance.”
 It was night. The streets of the town were 
drowned in silence. A hazy veil of clouds stretched 
across the sky, and the gusts of wind seemed like 
whispers slipping between old walls. Everyone 
was asleep in their homes, except for one young 
man who remained awake in his room. Sitting 
before the dim glow of an oil lamp, he kept turning 
the beads of his rosary and shaping the yearning 
of his heart into words.
 The prayer that rose from the depths of his 
heart echoed even through the silence. 
Suddenly... there was a gentle knock at the door. 
Startled, he got up, brought the lamp closer, and 
walked toward the door. He opened it, but no one 
was there. The street was completely empty. 
Bewildered, he thought perhaps it was just his 
imagination. He shut the door and sat down again. 
 Moments later, the knock came once more. 
This time, he rose quickly. When he opened the 
door, an elderly man stood before him, his face 
luminous, his expression serene, and his eyes 
shining with a light that seemed to reach straight 
into the soul. The old man spoke softly,“My son, 
there is a traveller wounded and hungry on the 
road. Can you help him?”

Supplication and Weeping
Farzand-e-Zahra (atfs) Foundation (Regd.)
Mumbai (INDIA)
A new calm appeared in the student’s eyes...as if 
his heart whispered: "I will not stop crying”.
 In the north of Iran, at the foot of the 
mountains, there was a simple chamber.
Ayatollah Hasan Zadeh Amoli (R.A.) sat in his 
circle of students. The beads of his rosary moved 
slowly through his fingers. The gathering was 
filled with deep tranquillity, and the students sat 
silently with reverence. 
 After a moment of hesitation, a young student 
asked: "Master... I cry a lot in my prayers. I weep 
with a broken heart and beg sincerely, but after 
some days I return to the same state. Nothing 
seems to change. Are my tears going to waste?”
Ayatollah Hasan Zadeh paused his beads, smiled 
gently, and said with affection:
Remember... the stains of sin take years to build 
up; to wash them away needs continuous rain. So 
keep crying, keep praying, keep breaking down...
One day you will realize that everything has 
changed—
and that day will not be the day of your 
supplication, it will be the day of your acceptance.”
"My dear son... Tears shed with sincerity are 
never wasted. Why do you assume their effect 
must appear instantly? Sometimes God buries 
those tears in the earth like seeds, so that when 
the time comes, they grow within you into a tree 
whose roots can never reach sin. With every 
prayer and every tear, you cleanse your heart...
And one day you will see that this heart has 
become pure.

Pure Saffron
 In one of his writings, Grand Ayatullah 
Shaykh Lutfullah Safi Gulpaygani elucidated 
upon some issues in regards to the per-sonality 
of Sayyidah Zahra, (s.a.). 
 Fāțimiyyah refers to the annual programs 
which are held throughout the Muslim world to 
commemorate the martyrdom of Fatima Zahra 
(s.a.), the only daughter of Prophet Muhammad, 
(s.a.) 
 In speaking about commemorating the [days] 
of Fatimiyyah¹, he stated that, “...in every 
religious event and at every opportunity [which 
we are given], we must speak about her 
standpoints, life, her traits of asceticism, worship 
[of God], and her knowledge..."
 As there are numerous dates in history on 
when she left this world and no one knows for 
sure on which day she died, the scholars have 
deemed that it is best to remember her on the two 
most well-known dates - 
75 days after the death of the Messenger of 
God,(s.a.) and 95 days after the death of the 
Messenger of God (s.a.).
Ayyame Azaye 
Fatimiyyah 

 Amongst those killed by this cruel tyrant were 
Kumail Ibn Ziyad Nakha'i - the companion of ‘Ali (‘a), 
Qambar - the slave of ‘Ali (‘a), Yahya Ibn Umm al-Tawil - 
a companion of Imam Sajjad (‘a), Sa'id Ibn Jubair, who 
has been greatly praised and commended by Imam 
Sajjad (‘a) and numerous other celebrated 
personalities.
 Hajjaj, at the time of his birth, did not possess an 
excretory opening; left with no other option, his parents 
were forced to create an opening in his rear.
 He was appointed governor and the commander of 
the army by 'Abdul Malik Ibn Marwan and ruled for 
twenty years till he died in the year 95 ah (during the rule 
of Walid Ibn 'Abdul Malik) at the age of fifty four.
 In the biography of Hajjaj Ibn Yusuf Thaqafi - the 
bloodthirsty Umayyad, it has been reported that his 
mother, Fari'ah, had initially been the wife of Harith Ibn 
Kaldah - a well-known doctor, who divorced her when 
she picked her teeth at an inopportune time; it was later 
that she entered into the wedlock of Yusuf Ibn 'Aqil 
Thaqafi.
 In addition to this, he would also not drink the milk 
from the breast of his mother and this left the parents 
worried and wondering as to what should be done.
 One day, an evil person approached them and 
instructed them that in order to remedy this problem 
they should kill a black goat and make Hajjaj drink its 
blood. When the goat was killed and the blood put into 
his mouth, Hajjaj began sucking and licking it. The 
following day the person directed them to kill a goat and 
pour its blood into his mouth. On the third day he 
ordered them to kill a black snake, pour its blood into his 
mouth and rub it upon his face as well whereupon from 
the fourth day onwards Hajjaj began feeding himself 
with the milk of his mother.
 In the course of this period he killed a hundred and 
twenty thousand people, and at the time of his death, 
his roofless prison contained fifty thousand male and 
thirty thousand female prisoners - majority of them bare 
and unclothed.
 As a result of this ignorant act, he grew up into such 
a savage and bloodthirsty individual that he would say: 
“I derive maximum pleasure by shedding blood - 
especially the blood of the descendents of the Noble 
Prophet (S).”
Do Not Sit At Every Conversation
Imam al-Jawad (‘a) is narrated to have said: 
“He who listens to a speaker has worshiped 
him. Therefore, if the speaker speaks of God, 
he has worshipped God and if he speaks of 
Satan, he has worshipped Satan.”
Therefore, those who listen to positive and 
truthful words will find positivity and truth taking 
root in their souls, while those who listen to 
negative and deviant words will find those 
attributes taking root in their souls. Therefore, we 
must always be careful not to sit in the company 
of negative speakers so that their words do not 
affect us in a detrimental way.
Brief Commentary
 Whenever someone speaks in regards to any 
topic, he exerts a certain influence over those 
who hear him. Similarly, when someone listens 
to another’s speech, he is influenced by those 
words as well. In this same way, words can be 
positive or negative, and in some cases, they 
can be a mixture of both truth and falsehood. 
When one sits complacently and listens to 
another’s speech, it is a type of worship in the 
sense that the words take root in their soul and 
exert their own influence and effect.
LESSONS OF LIFE - 80

 Hajjaj the Tyrant
Branches: Haidery Jama Masjid, Mira Road & Najaf-e-Hind, Jogipura, Najibabad (UP)

Surely, your body has right on you
Ans: When tap water is used and the Najis item (A'yn 
al-Najasah) is removed then there is no question of 
impurity remains. Cat food by itself is not necessarily 
Najis unless it contains Najis ingradeint.
Q1: Can you clarify the concept of free will in 
relation to the Hadith in Sahih Muslim 2650? I have 
heard that Allah's knowledge causes things to 
happen, yet this hadith suggests everything is 
predestined, raising questions about the existence 
of free will.
Ans: Free will of every human being is a Quranic fact 
which can never be denied, Every human being is free 
to be a believer or a disbeliever, then all will meet the 
results of their own deeds and decisions. In Quran (We 
Have Guided him to the right way, then he decides 
whether to be a grateful or ungrateful. Sura 76, Verse 3.
The Knowledge of Allah (SWT) is unlimited and He 
Knows who will do what and when and where, but it 
never means forcing people to do wrong. Those who 
do wrong do it by their own decision and free will same 
those who do good. Allah (SWT) Helps doing good and 
never Helps doing bad.
Q3: Is engaging in sports and exercise considered 
Mustahab or Makrouh? Are there any relevant 
narrations regarding this topic?
Ans: Practicing sports and physical exercise which 
help our body and health is recommended as the 
Hadeeth states: 
ً
ّ
 َّ
 حقا. علیك دك  
ِ
لجسإن 
ََ
ِ
َ
َ
Q2: If a container of cat food was washed under tap 
water, causing spills, and some small amount of 
water was added to purify it without removing the 
impurity, does that make the sink area impure?
Ans: The Prayer is still valid as far your intention to 
continue praying for the sake of Allah  is not terminated 
or stopped or changed. Distraction during the prayer is 
from Shaitan who always tries to disturb us and spoil 
our relationship with Allah. It does not invalidate the 
prayer but you need to focus again on the prayer and 
avoid the Satanic thoughts (whispering).
Also (Surely, Allah Likes the strong person)
Q4: Did Zainab bint al-Nabi, the daughter of the 
Prophet (S), have two children named Ali ibn Abi 
al-A'as and Umamah bint Abi al-A'as? Also, did 
Umamah bint Abi al-A'as have a son named 
Muhammad al-Awsat ibn Imam Ali?
Ans: Zainab was one of the three fostered daughters 
of the Prophet Muhammad (SAWA) and Khadeejah 
(AS). Many scholars say that the only biological 
daughter of the Prophet was Fatima (AS). Zainab had 
a daughter called Umamah bunt Abi Al-A'aas or bint 
Al-A'aas. Umamah was married to Imam Ali (AS) after 
the martyrdom of Lady Fatima (AS) and according to 
Lady Fatima's will. It is mentioned that Umamah has a 
son called Muhammad Al-Awsat son if Imam Ali (AS) 
who was martyred in Karbala.
Ans: Yes it permissible to perform Ghusl while taking 
a shower using soap and shampoo. You need to have 
the intention of performing Ghusl for the sake of Allah, 
then making water reach to your head and neck, then 
the right side of your body then the left side of your 
body.
Q7. I pray regularly, but I sometimes get distracted 
during my prayers. Does this affect the validity of 
my prayer? What factors influence whether a 
prayer is considered valid or invalid?
Biharul Anwaar V.70, page 128.
Biharul Anwaar , V.64, page  184.
Q6: I performed Ghusl after getting a haircut, but I 
noticed some small hair fragments remained on 
my skin and in my hair. Is my Ghusl still valid, or 
do I need to repeat it?
Ans: Your Ghusl is valid because small hair 
fragments do not prevent water from reaching to your 
body.
Q5: Is it permissible to perform Ghusl while taking 
a normal shower, using soap and shampoo 
simultaneously? Does this impact the validity of 
the Ghusl?
