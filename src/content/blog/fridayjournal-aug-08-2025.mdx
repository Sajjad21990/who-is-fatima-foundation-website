which marks the anniversary of the Battle of 
Karbala.
Symbolic connection: Imam Mahdi (atfs)'s 
uprising and the tragedy of Karbala are seen 
as links in the chain of the ongoing struggle 
between truth and falsehood.
Ziyarat of Ashura: The link between Imam 
Mahdi (atfs) and Imam Husain (a.s.) is also 
found in Ziyarat of Ashura (a prayer recited in 
remembrance of Imam Husain (a.s.)), where 
believers ask for the opportunity to seek 
revenge with the victorious Imam from the 
family of Muhammad (s.a.). 
In essence, the narrative of Imam Mahdi 
(atfs)'s return is 
deeply 
intertwined with 
the historical 
event of Karbala, 
embodying a 
promise of justice 
and retribution for 
the injustices 
suffered by Imam 
Husain (a.s.) and 
his family.

Imam Sadiq (a.s) said:"Whoever visits Husain (a.s) with 
recognition of his rightful status, it is as if he has visited 
Allah upon His Throne."(Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 98, p. 245)
Ma'rifah is the lamp that lights the way and the mirror in 
which the visitor sees both their true self and their Imam. 
3. Fulfilling the Rights of Others: A Condition of 
Truthfulness. The journey to Karbala involves not only the 
rights of Allah but also the rights of His creation. One who 
oppresses others, usurps rights, or breaks hearts—and 
then believes that the Ziyarat of Husain (a.s) will wash 
away their sins—has misunderstood its purpose. Imam 
Husain (a.s) is the Imam of the oppressed. In his presence, 
the oppressor’s tears and laments carry no meaning. The 
Qur’an clearly states:“Allah only accepts from the God-
conscious.”(Surah al-Ma’idah: 27), So how can a heart that 
has wronged others hope for acceptance at Karbala? 
Before setting out, one must return the rights, heal the 
hearts, and repent from injustice. Only then is one worthy 
of saying: "Labbayk Ya Husain!" 
4. Avoiding Illicit (Haraam) Income: The Purity of Ziyarat. 
The path to Karbala is a path of purity, and it begins with 
purifying one's provisions. Whether it’s the money spent, 
the ride taken, the clothes worn, or the food consumed—if 
they are tainted by haraam (forbidden) earnings, how can 
 Visiting Karbala is not merely a journey—it is an 
invitation. An invitation from Imam Husain (a.s) extended to 
the free souls of every era. But like every invitation, there 
are certain conditions for acceptance—certain etiquettes, 
spiritual preparations, and moral qualifications. 
Ziyarat of Karbala is not a sightseeing tour; it is a covenant, 
a pledge, an expression of devotion and loyalty. 
1. Sincerity of Intention: The journey to Karbala begins 
from the heart. If its purpose is mere display, tourism, or 
fulfilling a customary ritual, then it cannot lead one to the 
station of Husain (a.s). Sincerity is the first 
threshold—without crossing it, no pilgrim can truly reach 
the sacred shrine, even if their body does. 
2. Ma'rifah (Recognition) of the Imam: The Soul of 
Ziyarat without Ma'rifah (deep understanding), Ziyarat 
becomes a mere formal visit. With Ma'rifah, it becomes a 
presence of the heart. It's not enough to simply consider 
Imam Husain (a.s) a martyred oppressed figure. The true 
Ziyarat is when the visitor approaches him as the Hujjat of 
Allah, the heir of the prophets, and the Ark of Salvation. 
Imam Sadiq (a.s) said:"Whoever visits Husain (a.s) 
seeking Allah and the Hereafter, Allah forgives all his past 
and future sins."(Kamil al-Ziyarat, p.150) 
(By: Shaoor Ja'afri)
6. Purpose of the Journey: Return, Repentance, and 
Renewal of Pledge. The journey to Karbala is not just a 
geographical one—it is a journey of the heart. It is a return 
from one’s past, one’s negligence, one’s sins—to stand in 
the ranks of Husain (a.s). If Ziyarat is merely seeing the 
shrine, shedding a few tears, and taking some photos, then 
it becomes nothing more than spiritual tourism. But if the 
essence of Ziyarat is to hear the call of Husain (a.s): "Is 
there anyone to help me?", and from deep within, the soul 
responds: "Labbayk Ya Husain!"— then that is true 
Ziyarat. This is the moment when humility of the heart, tears 
of the eyes, and repentance of the tongue bind a new 
covenant. It is that moment when the visitor lays down the 
wounds of the past at the feet of the Imam, and vows to 
reshape their life in the light of Karbala. Imam Husain’s 
caravan still moves forward—joining it is not a matter of 
physical presence, but of an awakened heart, sincere 
intention, and deeds turned from falsehood toward truth. If 
you are a Zahiri (outward) visitor but batini (inwardly) 
Yazeedi, then you have only seen the dust, not the face of 
light. But if you’ve brought truth, justice, and loyalty to life 
within yourself, then even if you never reach Karbala 
physically, your heart has already prostrated there. The true 
Ziyarat of Karbala is a mirror in which a person sees 
themselves—and if they don’t find themselves Husaini, they 
begin to repent and make a covenant to live as a 
representative of the Imam through word, deed, and 
conscience. Imam Sadiq (a.s) said:"Whoever intends to visit 
Husain (a.s) but is unable to go due to some excuse, Allah 
grants them the same reward as one who makes the 
journey."(Kamil al-Ziyarat, p. 293)
Ziyarat, which is a spiritual prayer before a beloved of God, 
cannot be accepted if it's burdened with the impurity of 
forbidden wealth. The awliya (friends of God) say:"Before 
heading to Karbala, purify your heart, your tongue, and your 
wealth—only then will your steps reach the feet of Husain 
(a.s)." 
5. Inner and Outer Etiquette: The land of Karbala is a 
sanctuary of reverence. Angels dwell at every step. Every 
grain of dust is soaked in the blood of martyrs. The wind 
carries the sighs of Zainab (a.s) and the tears of Sajjad (a.s). 
In such a place, loud laughter, heedlessness, or casual 
behavior strip the Ziyarat of its soul. 
such a person be accepted in the sacred court? 
Ziyarat is not just a bodily presence, but the soul’s 
arrival—and the soul can only reach when it is illuminated by 
halaal (permissible) means. 
Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s) said:"The prayer and alms of a 
person are not accepted if there is haram (forbidden) within 
his stomach."(Al-Kafi, vol. 2, p. 47)
Conditions for the Ziyarat of Karbala
... Arbaeen Walk ...

 They reached his court at a time when he had been 
busy consuming wine and so he ordered the drinks to be 
removed. When the group had entered the court, 
Mughairah Ibn Amir sat down alongside the king near 
the royal bed. Witnessing this, Yazdgard, in a state of 
protest, said: “You Arabs initially came to our lands for 
trading and begging, and after you had consumed the 
tasty food and the delicious water (of our land) you went 
and informed your friends. Now you return and claim to 
have brought a 'new religion.'
 Mughairah IbnAamir said: “Your statement 
regarding a difficult livelihood is correct and we too 
agree that there was a time when we used to eat mice 
and lizards, could not differentiate the lawful from the 
unlawful, kill our cousins for the sake of one turnip and 
even go on to brag about it. But then Allah, by means of 
His Prophet, sent for us a religion, stopped us from 
idolatry, guided us towards monotheism, and very soon 
we shall be targeting your country too.
 Your example is similar to that of the fox that had 
entered a garden with the intention of eating the grapes. 
The owner of the garden allowed him to eat and did not 
hurt him. The next day the fox brought other foxes along 
with him and, entering the garden, began eating the 
grapes. When the owner of the garden arrived and 
witnessed the scene, he bolted all the exits and killed 
them all.
 If I wished, I too could behave just like that but I know 
that you have drawn up your army because of your 
poverty and straitened livelihood. I shall give you 
abundant bounties and place over you a commander 
such that you would lead a life of ease and comfort.”
 O' Yazdgard! I give you the option to choose one out 
of three things: Become a Muslim so that you can 
continue to rule, pay the poll-tax or prepare for war.”
 During the caliphate of the second Caliph, Sad Ibn 
Waqqas in the company of a few others, started out for 
Iran. Yazdgard, the king of Persia who was in the city of 
Madain at that time, sent a herald to Sad inviting some of 
the people in his caravan to come to his court so that he 
could become aware of their destination.
 Hearing this, Yazdgard was overcome with rage and 
said: “Nothing, save a sword, can exist between you and 
me.” Having said this, he then drove them out of his 
court. Later, a war ensued between the two forces in 
which the Muslims emerged victorious.
Similarly, when it comes to spiritual issues and our 
level of preparedness, it is necessary to be so exact 
and detailed that if we were to die tomorrow, we 
would not have any defiencies or regrets. This 
means that we would have washed ourselves from 
any mistakes with a true repentance and we would 
have paid back in full anything we owed to the 
people in terms of their rights. If we live in such a 
way, then it will be possible for us to die tomorrow in 
a way where we are left without any regrets and 
sorrows over what we should have done.
This Life And The Next
The Way Of Working For 
Imam al-Ridha’ (‘a) is narrated to have said: 
 The aforementioned tradition details how Islam 
views our material and spiritual lives both in this 
world and the next. A Muslim should be living his life 
in this world in such a firm and established way that 
it seems as if he is going to live in this world forever. 
This statement completely destroys the ideology of 
false asceticism which some people have tried to 
attribute to Islam.
“Work towards the life of this world as if you will 
live forever and work towards the next as if you 
will die tomorrow.”

Has granted human beings the option to decide 
their their own deeds with out any pressure from 
Him and Promised to reward the good deeds and 
punish the criminals in their own evil deeds.
