Imam Ali (a.s.) and Justice
 On one of the occasions when Muawiyah 
had gone for Hajj, he made inquires about a 
woman, by the name of Darmiyah Hajuniyah, 
who was well-known for her long standing 
support for ‘Ali (‘a) and her enmity towards 
Muawiyah. 
 Having been informed that she was alive, 
he ordered her to be brought before him. When 
she had arrived, he asked her: 
“Do you have any idea as to why I have 
summoned you before me? I have brought you 
here to know why you love ‘Ali (‘a) and harbour 
animosity towards me.”
Muawiyah insisted: “You must answer me.”
The woman said: “It is better if you refrain from 
such talks.”
She said: “or the simple reason that ‘Ali (‘a) 
was a just person and supported equality 
whereas you needlessly fought him. I approve 
of ‘Ali (‘a) because he loved the poor whereas I 
detest you because you shed unwarranted 
blood, spread dissensions and discords 
amongst the Muslims, adjudicate oppressively 
and unfairly, and act in accordance to your 
carnal desires!!”
 Muawiyah was infuriated and an impolite 
dialogue ensued between the two, but 
eventually Muawiyah stifled his anger and as 
per his habit, exhibiting gentleness, he 
asked: 
“Did you see ‘Ali (‘a) with your own eyes?” 
She replied: “Yes.” He then asked: “How?” 
Muawiyah said: “Have you heard his voice?” 
She replied: “Yes. A voice that would burnish 
the heart and clear the turbidity from it just as 
olive oil clears away the rust.”
She said: “By Allah! I had seen him in a state 
such that this kingdom and sultanate, which 
has deceived you and made you heedless 
had neither deceived him nor made him 
heedless.”
Muawiyah said: “Do you desire anything?” 
She said: “Shall you give me whatever I ask 
for?” When he had replied in the affirmative, 
she said: “Give me one hundred red-haired 
camels.”
 Muawiyah said: “If I give them to you, 
would you look upon me as you look upon ‘Ali 
(‘a)?” Defiantly, she said: “Never.”
 However, Muawiyah ordered one hundred 
red-haired camels to be given to her and then 
commented: “Had ‘Ali (‘a) been alive, he 
would not have given you even one of these.”
 Hearing this, the woman retorted: “By 
Allah! He would not have given me even one 
single hair of these camels, for he considered 
them to be the property of all the Muslims.”

 As he said this, he (S) plucked out a hair from 
the hump of a camel and said: “By Allah! From 
the spoils of war, I shall not take anything more 
than the khums, even in the measure of this hair, 
and that too, I shall gift to you. You too, with 
respect to the spoils of war, should not be 
unfaithful - not even in the measure of a needle 
or a yarn, for theft with regards to it only merits 
ignominy and the fire of Hell.”
 They created such a commotion that he (S) 
had to retreat towards a tree and in the tumult, 
his cloak was pulled off his shoulders. He (S) 
said: “Hand me back my cloak. By the Allah, in 
whose power lies my soul! Had there been 
camels, cows and sheep equivalent to the 
number of trees on the face of the earth, I would 
have surely distributed them amongst you.”
 A person from amongst the Ansar (The 
Helpers) stood up, brought out a woven yarn and 
said: “I had taken this to weave a saddle for my 
camel!”
 When the battle of Hunain concluded and the 
spoils of war were about to be distributed, some 
of the Bedouins, who had participated in the war 
approached the Noble Prophet (S) and said: “O' 
Prophet of Allah! Grant us a share too.”
 The Noble Prophet (S) said: “I gift to you my 
share that exists in this yarn.” Hearing this, the 
man said: “If the accounting and distribution has 
to be so accurate and severe, then I do not need 
this yarn.” Saying this, he dropped the yarn onto 
the ground
 Our hearts are the root of all of our actions 
and if we possess pure hearts, then likewise, 
our actions will be pure and wholesome as 
well. In front of God’s judgement, the only 
successful people are those who possess 
these valuable things.
 Islam has explicitly mentioned that such 
judgements are actually incorrect and 
misguided. What God really judges are our 
hearts (meaning our intentions and beliefs) and 
our actions. 
The Prophet (S) is narrated to have said: 
Valuable Investments
 Even though most societies judge people 
based on how they look and how much money 
they have, 
“God does not look at your faces and your 
wealth; rather, he looks at your hearts and 
your actions.”

not pray Maghrib and ‘Isha until midnight, what

prayer from being established.
