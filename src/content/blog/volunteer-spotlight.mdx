Volunteers are the heartbeat of Who is Fatima Foundation. They bring passion, skills, and tireless energy to our cause. Today, we want to shine a light on some of these incredible individuals.

## Meet Zoya

Zoya, a 22-year-old college student, spends her weekends teaching English at our Malad center.
"I realized that I have a privilege—education," she says. "Sharing it is the least I can do. Seeing the confidence grow in these kids is my biggest reward."

## Meet Mr. Sharma

A retired banker, Mr. Sharma helps us manage our accounts and ensures every penny is accounted for.
"Retirement shouldn't mean doing nothing," he asserts. "It's the perfect time to give back to society using the skills I've honed over decades."

## Why Volunteer?

Volunteering isn't just about helping others; it's about personal growth.
*   **Connect**: Meet like-minded people who share your values.
*   **Learn**: Gain new skills and experiences.
*   **Fulfill**: Experience the profound joy of making a difference.

We are always looking for more hands and hearts. Come, join our family of heroes.
