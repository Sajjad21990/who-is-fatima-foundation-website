At Who is Fatima Foundation, we believe that transparency is the cornerstone of trust. When you donate, you're not just giving money; you're investing in a life, a future, and a community.

## Where Does Your Money Go?

We operate with a 100% donation policy for specific projects. This means:
*   **Education**: Your funds buy books, uniforms, and pay for teacher salaries.
*   **Healthcare**: Every rupee goes towards medical camps, medicines, and surgeries.
*   **Water Projects**: Direct costs for drilling, installation, and maintenance of wells.

## Tracking Impact

We provide regular updates to our donors. For every major project, we share:
1.  **Photos and Videos**: See the direct result of your contribution.
2.  **Beneficiary Stories**: Hear from the people whose lives you've touched.
3.  **Financial Reports**: Detailed breakdowns of expenditure.

Your generosity fuels our mission. Together, we are building a world where compassion translates into tangible action.
