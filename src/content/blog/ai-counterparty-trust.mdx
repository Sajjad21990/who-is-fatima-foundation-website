A threat we're not talking about enough is this - not only that AI might become uncontrollable, but that humans get great at controlling AI.

If you are still debating whether you can trust AI with important decisions, you are fighting yesterday's battles. 
Humans have already demonstrated that a skilled prompt engineer can [manipulate an AI](https://www.freysa.ai/act-1) for their own gains. 

But that doesn't change anything. We still blindly believe Claude, ChatGPT and MetaAI for information. Soon, we will blindly trust them to take actions on our behalf.

The question isn't "Can we trust AI with actions?", but rather "What if AI is the only thing we trust?".

# We've seen this play out

History shows us that trust is fragile. When we automate trust, we create new vulnerabilities.
