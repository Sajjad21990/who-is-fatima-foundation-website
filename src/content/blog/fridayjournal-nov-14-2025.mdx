The above points bring out the importance of 
justice in Islam. It is discussed at every place.
And I command you to establish justice 
between the people. (Surah Shura: 15)
Here enlivening does not indicate through 
water but Allah shall send such people who 
shall enliven the earth with justice. The earth 
shall be resuscitated by the revival of justice. 
The enforcement of divine laws on earth is 
more beneficial than the drops of rain”
Establishment of Justice is the basic reason for 
raising the Prophets (a.s.).
 Certainly We sent Our messengers with 
clear arguments, and sent down with them the 
Book and the balance that men may conduct 
themselves with equity; (Surah Hadeed: 25)
(Tafseer-o-Noor al-Saqlain, vol. 4, pg 173)
 We have been instructed to deal with justice 
and kindness in our social life too.
Imam Mohammad Baqir (a.s.) while explaining 
the above verse says:
Surely Allah enjoins the doing of justice and the 
doing of good (to others) and the giving to the 
kindred, and He forbids indecency and evil and 
rebellion; He admonishes you that you may be 
mindful. (Surah Nahl : 90)
(Al –Kafi, vol. 7 Pg 174)
Allah shall enliven the earth through the Qaem 
when it (earth) would have died on account of 
the disbelief of its inhabitants.
Allah told His Messenger (s.a.w.a):

“Allah shall enliven the earth after its death”.
Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) says:
“Justice is the foundation on which this world is 
based”; “Justice is the foundation of nations and the 
adornment for the rulers.”; “Justice is the shield of the 
governments”; “Justice reforms people and in it is the 
betterment of the masses”; “Justice leads to increase 
in blessings”.
 With the advent of Imam Mahdi (atfs), it is 
believed that universal justice will finally be 
established, fulfilling the long-held aspirations of the 
oppressed.
Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a) says:
Imam Musa Kazim (a.s.) says while explaining the 
verse:
“Behaving with justice for an hour is better than sixty 
years of worship during which one prays in the nights 
and fasts during the days. Similarly ruling unjustly 
and with oppression for an hour is more abhorred by 
Allah than committing sins for sixty years”; “The 
heavens and earth subsist due to justice”
 Allah has made several similar promises and all 
His promises shall be fulfilled by the reappearance of 
Hazrat Wali-e-Asr (atfs). The first thing that crosses 
our minds while discussing the reappearance of 
Imam Mahdi (atfs) is the establishment of justice and 
equity. The reappearance of Imam Mahdi (atfs) is the 
divine promise for the cause of establishment of 
justice. Before we proceed further let us understand 
the importance of justice in Islam.

Pondering on Surah Naas and Surah Falaq
1. From the evil of that which He has created,
Now, look at “Surah An-Naas”:
I seek refuge in:
...from only one thing—and that thing is:
 Have you ever pondered over the last two 
Surahs of the Qur'an?
 Whereas, in Surah An-Naas (Mankind), refuge 
is sought from only one thing, but that one thing is 
even more dangerous in its destruction and 
devastation than the four things mentioned in 
Surah Al-Falaq.
Now, consider Surah Al-Falaq: refuge is sought 
from four things, but only one 'Attribute' of Allah 
Almighty is used as a means of appeal at its 
In “Surah Al-Falaq” (The Daybreak), refuge is 
sought in Allah from four things, and all four of 
them are very dangerous, frightening, and 
destructive.
beginning:
Qul A'ūdhū bi-Rabbil-Falaq
I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak. 
From these four things:
2. From the evil of the darkening (night) when it 
settles,
3. From the evil of the women who practice 
sorcery (blowing) on knots,
4. From the evil of the envier when he envies.
In it, refuge is sought from only one thing, but 
“three Attributes” of Allah Almighty are used as a 
means of appeal at its beginning:
Qul A'ūdhū bi-Rabb-in-Naas. Malik-in-Naas, 
Ilāhin-Naas
The Lord of mankind, The Sovereign/King and 
Owner of mankind, The true God of mankind,
The whisper of Al-Khannās.
O Lord of all mankind! O Emperor of all mankind! 
O True God of all mankind! Save me from the evil 
of the whisper of Al-Khannās This “Al-Khannās,” 
which means the hidden enemy, whether he is a 
man, a jinn, or a devil...
A husband and wife are living in love; someone 
comes, speaks a couple of words while laughing 
and playing, sows the seed of *waswasah* 
(whisper/suggestion) in the heart of one of them, 
and leaves... 
 It is a very dangerous matter...very 
dangerous... if a whisper enters the heart, then 
there is nothing but destruction.
 That person's two-word whisper alone ruins 
such a beautiful and close relationship... and 
love vanishes... sadness, grief, and complaints 
are born.
 You love a good person... you benefit 
religiously from his love... a tale-bearer comes... 
in the course of conversation, he subtly drops 
something in your ear that... turns your love into 
**hatred and suspicion**... and the effort and 
love of many years is ruined in minutes...
 Al-Khannās is one who directly strikes your 
heart... and you don't even realize it... and he 
hides after making that strike. The meaning of 
hiding is that... either he is not visible at all... or 
he appears to be a friend and well-wisher on the 
surface... but in reality, he implants some evil 
into your heart. 
 Similarly, the devils who are jinn are invisible; 
they cast you into such a delusion that you 
cannot stop yourself, and in the storm of this 
delusion... how many of your relationships, 
blessings, and loves are swept away like 
straws...
 May Allah Almighty protect us from the evil of 
all kinds of **Al-Khannās**.  Aameen.

 When the Noble Prophet (S) conquered 
Mecca, he announced a general amnesty for all 
the people - except a few individuals, who were 
to be killed whenever found; amongst these 
were 'Abdullah Ibn Zab'ari, who used to satirize 
him (S), Wahshi, who had killed his uncle 
Hamzah in the battle of Uhud9, 'Ikramah Ibn Abi 
Jahl, Safwan Ibn Umayyah and Habbar Ibn al-
Aswad - all of whom he eventually pardoned 
after they were brought before him (S).
 After the conquest of Mecca he approached 
the Noble Prophet (S), expressed regret over his 
misdeed and, seeking forgiveness, said: “O' 
Prophet of Allah! We were of the polytheists, 
however Allah, by means of you, guided us aright 
and delivered us from perdition, so disregard my 
ignorance and that which you have heard about 
me, and pardon me!”
 As for Habbar Ibn al-Aswad, he was the 
person who frightened Zainab - the Noble 
Prophet's (S) daughter, who had been sent 
towards Madinah by her husband, Abu al-Abbas 
Ibn Rabi' - on the way to Madinah as a result of 
which she suffered a miscarriage. Subsequent to 
this act of his, the Noble Prophet (S) had 
declared it permissible to shed his blood.
 The Noble Prophet (S) said: “I pardon you. 
Allah has exhibited kindness towards you in that 
He has guided you into Islam; with the 
acceptance of Islam, bygones become 
bygones.”
“Whenever you see someone who doesn’t care 
about what he says or what people say about 
him, then you should know that he is either 
corrupt or Satanic (in nature).”
Those With The Attributes Of Satan
The Prophet of Islam (S) is narrated to have 
said: 
 They will mention the worst types of slander 
while being utterly indifferent when similar things 
are directed towards them. When someone 
reaches such a state, then it is clear in regards 
to the evils which they are capable of 
committing. 
 At the same time, reformation is also very 
difficult because such individuals are past caring 
about themselves.
 When someone submerses themselves very 
deeply in sin, they will eventually reach a point 
where they don’t care what others say about 
them or what they say about others.

Q1: Is it permissible to talk with a non-mahram 
(someone of the opposite sex who is not closely 
related)?
a) The conversation must not contain any desire or 
sexual pleasure, even in the slightest way.
b) There should be no fear of falling into sin or 
committing something unlawful.
Answer: It is permissible under the following 
conditions:
c) The discussion should not include romantic, 
immoral, or provocative content that could cause 
mischief or lead to temptation.
d) A woman must not make her voice soft or delicate in 
a way that usually arouses the listener.
Answer: Some of the recommended (mustahabb) acts 
are as follows:
Q3: Describe the etiquettes and rulings regarding a 
newborn.
It is worth noting that this rule also applies to 
conversations with mahrams (close relatives).
Answer: A student who has cheated in some of their 
exams and thereby obtained a higher education 
certificate (such as a B.A., M.A., or Ph.D.) has 
committed a sin. If the person receives a higher salary 
based on that certificate but properly performs the 
duties of the job given to them, then their salary is 
lawful. However, if they do not possess the skills 
corresponding to the certificate, it is not permissible to 
present themselves in a governmental or non-
governmental institution under that title. It should be 
noted that making or presenting a fake certificate or 
degree as an original one is never permissible under 
any circumstances.
Q2: What is the ruling on fake degrees?
Offering a feast (Walima): 
Hold a feast on the day of the baby’s birth. However, if 
it is delayed for a few days, there is no harm.
Tahnik (putting something in the baby’s mouth): 
Put a small amount of water from the Euphrates 
(Furat) and soil from the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) 
in the baby’s mouth.
Select a virtuous and meaningful name for the 
newborn.
Choosing a good name: 
Circumcision.
Q4: What is the ruling on transplanting any part of 
the body from a living or dead person to another 
person?
If the donor is a child or mentally unsound, then in no 
case is it permissible. When such organ removal is 
allowed, taking payment for it is also permissible. 
It is not lawful to remove a body part—such as an eye 
or hand—from a deceased Muslim and transplant it 
into the body of a living person. If someone does so, 
compensation (diyah) becomes obligatory, and the 
removed organ must be buried. However, if the 
transplanted organ has become part of a living 
person’s body, it should not be removed afterward. If a 
person leaves a will that any part of their body be given 
for transplantation after death, acting upon such a will 
involves difficulty and should not be carried out.
Shave the baby’s head on the seventh day (if there is 
no risk of harm), and give charity in gold or silver equal 
to the weight of the shaved hair. It is disliked (makruh) 
to shave only part of the head and leave some hair.
Answer: Cutting off a part of a living human body for 
transplant, if it causes significant harm to the 
donor—such as removing an eye, a hand, or similar 
organs—is prohibited. 
However, if it causes no serious harm, such as taking 
a piece of skin, bone marrow, or one kidney (provided 
the other kidney is healthy and functioning properly), 
and the donor gives it willingly, then it is permissible. 
Performing Aqeeqah (sacrifice).
Shaving the baby’s head: 
Recite the Adhan in the baby’s right ear and the 
Iqamah in the left ear on the day of birth, before the 
umbilical cord falls off.
Bathing the newborn: 
Give the baby a bath after birth, provided there is no 
harm or risk involved.
Reciting Adhan and Iqamah:
