called Muslim nations are at their peak. On one hand, 
they hold gatherings in support of the oppressed and 
declare their support, while on the other hand, they 
consider it an honor for themselves to kiss the hands 
of those very oppressors and flatter them.
Master! These treacherous ones raise slogans of 
"Unity on Monotheism" and merely pay lip service to 
the oppression faced by the children of Tawhid 
(Monotheism). On one hand, they speak against the 
oppression inflicted upon the oppressed, while on the 
other hand, they provide weapons to the oppressors.
My Beloved! Where are you? The fire of selfishness 
and tyranny of the oppressors and the rulers who 
have forgotten God is pushing the world towards ruin.
O my Merciful Imam! I know that you know everything, 
but my heart is heavy, and I must tell you how dark the 
world has become, and how everyone is only 
engrossed in their own concerns.
The First Qibla and its custodians have been victims 
of oppression for decades.
Humanity is agonizing due to the crimes of the 
usurpers of the First Qibla and the oppression and 
betrayals of those who have seized the Second Qibla 
and the Holy Sanctuaries. Mankind is lamenting, and 
humanity is sighing in pain.
O my dear Imam! Every Friday, I hope that you will 
come, but I do not know when you will arrive.
My Beloved! I am extremely restless, and I know that 
you know. O Yousuf of Zahra (as)! Our circumstances 
are before you, so please pray to God yourself that 
your advent be near and that you take hold of the 
people's hands...(continued page 2)

I do not know where you are, but I know that you 
know everything. It is my misfortune that I see 
everything, but my eyes long for your vision.
O You who will fill the world with justice and equity! 
The world is burning in the fire of oppression, 
injustice, and disobedience. You know that the 
heads of Shia children are being severed, 
oppression is being inflicted upon Shias in places of 
the world.
The proof of design, which establishes the existence 
of God, also proves your blessed existence; for just 
as this universe could not have been created without 
a Creator, similarly, this system of the universe 
cannot remain without an Imam.
O Beloved and dear one of Allah!I believe in your 
existence just as I believe in the existence of God.
My Master! I do not know where you are, but if you 
were not, this sky would have collapsed and this 
earth would have perished.
O my Imam! My greetings be upon you.
O Dweller of Occultation! Although I know that your 
veil is also a mercy, for veils are upon many, and 
when the veil is lifted, not only will you appear, but 
the realities of many will be revealed.
But, Master! I wish to share the pain of my heart with 
you. To seek your help and call upon you. Although I 
neither have the manner of asking, nor do I possess 
the method of supplication.
Master! Muslims are enduring pain and hardships.
My Master! The crimes and oppression of the tyrants 
have increased, the betrayals of the rulers of so-
Justice will prevail only after Zohoor

The Friday Journal - 03rd Oct.. 2025 - Pg.2
Those who accept the Wilayat
Farzand-e-Zahra (atfs) Foundation (Regd.)
Mumbai (INDIA)
 When the people see this, they will weep and scream, “O 
Mohammad!” 
 So there will not be anyone left who loved us (the Ahlul 
Bayt ), who accepted our WILAYAT (authority), and who 
renounced and hated our enemies, who will not join our 
group and come to the Pool.
 Then Allah will say, “O Mohammad, I have granted them 
to you.  I have forgiven them for you and have removed their 
sins.  I have allowed them to join you and your progeny 
whom they loved, and I have allowed them to come to your 
Pool. I accepted your intercession on their behalf and I have 
honoured them.”
 Then a caller will call from the Throne, “Where is the 
Prophet of Makkah?”
 When the Prophet  sees any of our followers who 
are not allowed to come close to the Pool, he will start 
crying.
 On the Day of Judgement, Allah will gather all of the 
people in one desert, from the first to the last, naked and 
barefoot.  They will stand in that desert and will start 
sweating profusely.  Their breath will become very 
heavy until a time that only Allah knows and, “You shall 
not hear a sound but a whisper” (20:108).
The people will reply, “Call him with his name.”
 The caller will call again, “Where is the Prophet of 
Mercy, Mohammad bin Abdullah?”
 Then the Messenger of Allah  will stand up and walk 
in front of all of the people until he arrives at a Pool which 
is as long as the distance between Aila and Sanaa’.
 Then the caller will call the Commander of the 
Believers Ali bin Abi Taleb will stand up and walk until he 
gets to the Prophet .
 Then Allah will allow the rest of the people to start 
moving.  Some people will be allowed to come to the 
Pool and some will not. 
The Prophet  will say, “O Lord!  These are Shia of Ali!”
So Allah will send an angel to the Prophet  to ask him, 
“Why are you crying?”  
The Prophet  will reply, “How can I not be crying when I 
see some of Ali’s Shia have been stopped from coming 
to the Pool and are being moved toward the people of 
Hell?” 
Peace be upon you, peace be upon your pure forefathers.
If I call myself an awaitter, my conscience asks: What 
preparation have you made for the Zohoor?
The world and its people do not believe in you,but I say that the 
world revolves around your blessed existence, and God 
created the world for your luminous being.
What should I call myself?
If I call myself a Shia,I do not find those qualities in myself.
O Imam of the oppressed and helpless!When and where will 
your mount appear, and you, mounted upon it, illuminate our 
hearts?
Your Muntazir
O my Imam!I and others like me are in dire need of your 
existence. Please take hold of our hands so that we may not 
stray from the path of truth and may become your true awaiters.
If I call myself a lover, how can I present the requirements 
and proofs of that love?

 Jabir Ibn Abdullah Ansari, who had been of 
the companions of the Noble Prophet (S), had 
remained alive till the time of Imam Al-Baqir (‘a) 
but had become old and blind by then.
 As soon as Jabir heard the Imam's (‘a) 
speech he kissed his (‘a) face and said: “The 
Noble Prophet (S) had spoken the truth.” He had 
said: “O' Jabir! You shall continue to live till you 
meet one of my children whose name shall be 
Al-Baqir. He shall split open knowledge just as a 
cow splits open the earth.”
 The Imam (‘a) responded by saying: ”(On the 
contrary) if Allah makes me old, I prefer old age; 
if He desires to give me youth, I prefer youth; if 
He afflicts me with sickness, I desire sickness, 
and if He desires to favour me with sound health, 
I prefer soundness of health. If Allah wishes to 
give me death, I prefer death and if He wills to 
keep me alive, I desire to live.”
 Once, when he had arrived in the presence 
of the Imam (‘a), the Imam (‘a) inquired after his 
health, whereupon he said: “I find myself in a 
state such that I give preference to old age over 
youth, to sickness over soundness of health and 
to death over life!”
Brief Commentary
 In this tradition, Imam ‘Ali (‘a) has pointed out 
the greatest physical and spiritual blessings 
which one can have. Physical health is not only 
the greatest material blessing but it is the root of 
all other blessings as well. It is through means of 
our physical health that we are able to do 
everything else. 
Without physical health, such things like prayer, 
fasting, charity, and other good works would also 
not be possible for us.
When it comes to spiritual issues, the greatest 
blessing that one can have is a heart filled with 
faith in God. This is something which allows us 
to see the world as it is and which lights the way 
in front of us even in the depths of darkness. It is 
through faith that the disease of ignorance and 
sin are eliminated and one’s heart and body are 
made calm and peaceful.
The Best Of Blessings
Imam ‘Ali (‘a) is narrated to have said: 
“The best blessing is health and soundness, 
while the best thing which can fill one’s heart 
is faith in God.”

Ans: The reward if praying in any Masjid is greater than 
the reward of praying at home. The reward of 
congregational prayer is much greater than praying 
alone.
Q4: As a Muslim man, is it permissible for me to 
assist my adult adopted sister with washing while 
she is unclothed, if no female caregivers are 
Ans: This narration is in Saheeh Muslim which is the 
second most authentic books of Hadeeth among our 
Sunni brothers, in which Umar ibn al-Khattab  himself 
told Abdullah ibn Abbas that : You and Ali looked at Abu 
Bakr as a liar, traitor, licentious, then looked at me as a 
liar, traitor, licentious.
Q2: Is it better for me to pray Fajr in congregation at 
a Sunni mosque where the prayer starts 15 minutes 
after the Adhan, or should I pray at home instead?
Q1: I am concerned about a reference made by a 
Sunni friend to a hadith in Sahih Muslim (Hadith 
No. 4577) where Hazrat Abbas (RA) reportedly used 
harsh terms like شـــــــکن, عہد گنہگار, کاذب,  and  خائن
Could you please provide clarification on this?
Ans: Wearing acrylic nails in your nails prevents water 
of Wudhu or Ghusl from reaching to your real nails, 
hence invalidates your Wudhu and Ghusl. If you wear it 
after performing Wudhu or Ghusl then pray Salah, your 
Salah will be valid because your Wudhu or Ghusl were 
valid as you performed Wudhu or Ghusl with out 
wearing anything stops water from reaching to your 
nails.
Q3: Is it permissible for an 18-year-old girl to wear 
acrylic nails while performing Wudhu and Salah?
This statement of Umar reflects the stand and opinion 
of Ali (AS) about Abu Bakr and Umar.
Q7. What is the recommended way to perform 
Ghusl in a small bathroom where water might 
spill?
Q5: Is Velayat-e-Faqih the sole legitimate political 
system in Shia Islam? Additionally, does Islam 
permit the adoption of Western democratic 
principles?
Taqleed is acting upon the verdicts if the most learned 
scholar (Al-A’lam) who is considered by the high 
caliber scholars in the Hawza who are known as Ahlul 
Khibra .
Ans: Simply, make water reach your head and face 
and neck then your right side of your body, then the left 
side of your body. Obviously after having in your heart 
the intention of Ghusl for the sake of Allah (SWT).
Switching should be to the most learned Al-A’lam.
Q7. Is it permissible to glance at something else 
during prayer, like checking the time, without 
moving my head? I wanted to confirm which Rakat 
I was on. Does this invalidate my prayer, or is it 
still considered valid?
available and the care is necessary?
Ans: Your previous prayers and fasts and worship are 
valid as far as your intention was for the sake of Allah, 
and you did not violate any basic rule of worship.
Ans: Your adopted sister is not your real sister, so, 
you are not allowed to look at her unclothed. Hijab 
rules apply on you and her .
Ans: Welayat al-Faqeeh is an Islamic rule regarding 
the authorities of the Jurist being highly learned or the 
most learned in Islamic jurisprudence. These 
authorities are been discussed by great Shia scholars 
and all of them agree on the principle of the authorities 
if the jurist (Faqeeh) but there are different opinions on 
the extends if these authorities. 
Emergency has got its own exceptions just like 
emergency rules to save life of any other female who 
is non Mahram to you.
Q6: I chose a Marja based on his reputation for 
knowledge, but as a Baligh Shia, I am now 
reconsidering my choice. Are my past prayers and 
fasting valid? Am I allowed to switch to Sayyid 
Sistani or Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi?
Ans: The prayer will not be invalid but it is always 
better to keep our intention concentrated in our 
Prayers during performing Salah.
