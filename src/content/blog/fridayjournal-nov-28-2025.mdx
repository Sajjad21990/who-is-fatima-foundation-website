Faatimah, The Light of  My Eyes; Holy Prophet (s.a.)
“By the One Who made me a Prophet, I—and 
these [four]—have the highest rank before Allah 
among all creation, and on the face of the earth 
there is no one more beloved to me than them.
Shaykh Sadūq writes in his book:
 It is narrated from Ibn Abbās that one day the 
Messenger of God (peace be upon him and his 
family) was seated when Imam Hasan (peace be 
upon him) entered. The Prophet looked at him and 
began to weep. Then he said, “Come to me, my 
son,” and he seated him upon his right knee.
 Then the Commander of the Faithful (Alī, 
peace be upon him) arrived. The Prophet wept 
upon seeing him as well and seated him on his 
right side.
 Then Imam Husayn (peace be upon him) 
arrived. The Prophet looked at him and wept. 
again, and said, “Come, come, my child,” and he 
seated him upon his left knee.
“O Messenger of God, you wept upon seeing all of 
them. Was there no one among them whose sight 
made you happy?”
Ibn Abbās said:
 Then Fātimah (peace be upon her) came. The 
Prophet wept upon seeing her and seated her in 
front of him. 
He replied:
My daughter Fātimah is the leader of the women 
of all worlds. She is a part of my body, the light of  
my eyes, the comfort of my heart, and my very 
soul.
Whenever she stands in her prayer niche before 
her Lord, her light shines for the angels in the 
heavens just as the light of the stars shines for the 
inhabitants of the earth.
Allah says to His angels: ‘Look at My 
maidservant Fātimah, who stands before Me. 
Her heart trembles out of fear of Me, and she is 
devoted to My worship. Bear witness that I have 
granted her followers safety from the Fire.’
And she will be the first among my family to join 
me—coming to me grieving, afflicted, sorrowful, 
and martyred.
O Allah! Send Your curse upon the one who 
wronged her. Punish the one who deprived her of 
her right. Humiliate the one who dared to harm 
her. And keep forever in Hell the one who struck 
her side causing her child to be lost.”
‘O Lord, my heart is weary of life; take me to my 
father.’
And here I say:
Reference: Amālī of Shaykh Sadūq
When I looked at her, everything that will happen 
to her after me came to my mind. It is as though I 
see offensiveness entering her home, her 
sanctity violated, her right taken away, her side 
broken, her unborn child miscarried. She cries 
out, ‘O Muhammad!’ but no one answers her. 
She seeks help, but no one helps her.
Then she will fall ill, and Allah will send Maryam 
daughter of Imrān to care for her and keep her 
company. Then she will say:
After me she will always remain sorrowful and 
tearful—sometimes remembering the 
Revelation that used to descend upon her house 
and is now cut off, and sometimes remembering 
my separation. When at night she does not hear 
my recitation of the Qur’an, she is struck with 
fear. Seeing her own humiliation, she recalls the 
time of her father when she was honored.
And the angels say: Āmīn.

 One day, some people had come to the 
house of Imam Sajjad (‘a) as guests. Preparing 
the meals, one of Imam's (‘a) servants hastily 
pulled out the kebabs from the oven; as he did 
so, the skewers of the kebabs slipped from his 
grasp, fell upon the head of Imam Sajjad's (‘a) 
child, who had been standing below the ladder, 
and caused his death. The servant stood aghast 
and terribly perturbed, but the Imam (‘a) said: 
“You have not done it on purpose. Go away, for I 
have freed you in the way of Allah.” He then 
ordered that the child be given ablution, 
shrouded and buried.
 Sufiyan Thauri relates: “One day, arriving in 
the presence of Imam Al-Sadiq (‘a) I found him to 
be disturbed and unsettled. I sought to know the 
reason for it whereupon he (‘a) said: “I had 
prohibited everyone from climbing atop the roof 
of the house, however when I entered the house, 
I observed one of the slave-girls, who had been 
entrusted the responsibility of educating one of 
my children, standing atop the ladder with my 
infant in her arms. But as soon as she saw me, 
she was left dumbfounded and began to tremble 
as a result of which my son dropped out of her 
hands onto the ground and died. I am disturbed 
and uneasy over the fear that overtook the slave-
girl because of me. Nevertheless, I told her: 
“There is no sin upon you and I have set you free 
for the pleasure of Allah.
Imam ‘Ali (‘a) is narrated to have said: 
Brief Commentary
 The celebration that we hold after fasting for 
thirty days during the blessed month of 
Ramadan is in reality a celebration over our 
conquest of our lusts and desires. This is a 
celebration of our obedience to God and his 
commands. Therefore, such a day is a day of 
celebration for those who have obeyed God in 
his commands and have understood the ultimate 
philosophy of their actions. Yet for those who 
have dishonored such a month and who have 
not attempted to educate and train themselves in 
the obedience of God, such a day is nothing but 
a day of grief and sorrow.
The Real EId, The Real Day Of Celebration
“This day (the day of EÏd al-Fitr) is the EÏd of 
those whose fasting and worship has been 
accepted by God; and indeed, every day that 
you do not sin is a day of EÏd.

Answer: When performing prayer in a sitting position, 
after making the intention, say Takbīrat-ul-ihrām. After 
reciting Surah al-Hamd and another Surah, for rukū‘ 
(bowing), bend your head forward toward your knees 
as much as possible, then return to the sitting position. 
After that, perform sajdah. The second rak‘ah should 
be performed in the same manner. Recite tashahhud 
and salām while sitting.
Q1: How should one perform prayer while sitting?
Answer: If no object is present on which performing 
sajdah is valid, or such an object is present but it is not 
possible to perform sajdah on it due to extreme heat, 
cold, or any similar reason, then performing sajdah on 
qīr (bitumen) or asphalt is preferable to performing 
sajdah on other unsuitable things. If performing sajdah 
on these is also not possible, then one should perform 
sajdah on their sleeve or any other item on which 
sajdah is normally not permissible in ordinary 
circumstances. However, as a recommended 
precaution, one should not perform sajdah on 
anything else as long as performing it on one’s 
clothing is possible.
Q3: Can the names of the Infallibles (peace be 
upon them) be touched without ablution (wudū‘)?
Answer: As a recommended precaution, the names 
of the Holy Prophet, Lady Fatimah al-Zahra, and the 
infallible Imams (peace be upon them) should not be 
touched without ablution. Their names, patronymics 
(kunniyah), and titles deserve respect similar to the 
names of God and the words of the Qur’an.
Q4: What is the ruling on making supplications 
Q2: What is the ruling on performing sajdah on 
one’s hand?
Answer: There is no harm in making supplications 
during prayer, but as a recommended precaution, 
one should avoid supplicating in any language other 
than Arabic.
Answer: It is not paak.
Answer: If attending the wedding indicates approval 
of such activities, then attending is forbidden. 
Otherwise, if one does not listen attentively to the 
music or frivolous speech — even if the sound 
reaches the ears but attention is not given — then 
attending is permissible. If there is a possibility that 
forbidding the act will stop the music, then it is 
obligatory to forbid it.
Q5: Is it permissible to attend a wedding 
ceremony where music and singing are part of 
the program?
Answer: In itself, there is no harm in buying or selling 
hair.
during prayer?
Q6: Is it permissible for women to buy and sell 
hair?
Q7: Is it permissible to have someone else 
perform a hired (ijarah) prayer at a lower price?
Answer: If the circumstances do not indicate that the 
prayer must be performed by you personally, then 
you may have someone else perform it. However, 
giving it to someone for a lower price is not 
permissible, and the paid amount must be distributed 
equally across all days. However, if it was explicitly 
stipulated that you must perform the prayer yourself, 
then having someone else perform it is not 
permissible.
Q8: Is the blood that comes out during khuni 
matam (self-flagellation) considered paak?
Q9: What is meant by radde mazalim (restitution 
of wrongs)?
Answer: If someone owes a financial right to another 
person and it is not possible to reach the rightful 
owner, then giving that amount to the poor as charity 
on behalf of the owner is called radde mazalim. 
However, as a necessary precaution, this money 
cannot be given to the poor without the permission of 
a mujtahid or his representative.
